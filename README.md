# Neural-Networks-for-Machine-Learning-Coursera-Hinton
This repo is specially created for all the work done by me as a part of Coursera's Neural Networks for Machine Learning (Spring'17) course taught by Dr. Hinton (University of Toronto)

I will also be adding the in-video quizzes and programming assignments with solutions and explanations here.
